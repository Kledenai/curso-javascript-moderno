// Here we see that it will print an infinite number
console.log(7 / 0);

// Inside a string, js will check if the value can be assigned in the sum
console.log("10" / 2);

// It goes indefinite but we know why right :v
console.log("Show" * 2);

// The js spec is not that big so it won't return 0.8
console.log(0.1 + 0.7);

// This is a way to be able to apply a function on a broken number when you are already alone, if you put the value in your hand.
console.log((10.345).toFixed(2));
